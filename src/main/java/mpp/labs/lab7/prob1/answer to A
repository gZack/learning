D is class
    -so one of B or C must be an interface cause java doesn't support multiple

    -both are interfaces, in this case D has to provide an implementation to the method.
    or declare it as an abstract method which ultimately forces D to be an abstract
D is interface
    -in this case D has to provide a default implementation of
    the method or declare unimplemented
